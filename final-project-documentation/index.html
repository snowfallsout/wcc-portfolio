                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>Delicacies Sharing is an art website where different users can have different experiences within the site. 
                    The food on the table is reproducible and movable, and the user can arrange it in the shape of his or her choice.
                     Users can turn on the camera and relax while eating on the web. Mobile users can activate the AR function to place a virtual table in real space, decorated by themselves. 
                     The main element of the website is a gorgeous "oriental table", a project that I hope will ease people's anxiety and reduce body managers' fear of food.</p>

                <h3>Concept and Background Research</h3>
                
                <p>Delicacies Sharing is an art website that aims to promote food sharing and reduce anxiety around eating. 
                    The concept is rooted in the idea that food is not just fuel for the body, but also a source of pleasure, connection, and creativity. 
                    The website allows users to create their own virtual table and arrange food in a way that reflects their mood, taste, and culture. 
                    By sharing their virtual table with others, users can experience a sense of community and explore different culinary traditions. 
                    The website also incorporates the use of augmented reality to create a more immersive and interactive experience for mobile users.</p>

                <p>Food has great cultural significance to society. 
                    Many contemporary artists have explored the intersection of food and art, creating works in the form of installations, performances, etc. 
                    Rirkrit Tiravanija is a Thai artist known for his participatory installations that involve cooking and sharing food with visitors. 
                    Jennifer Rubell is an American artist who creates participatory art on a surprisingly large and engaging scale and uses food and drinks as a medium. 
                    The artist's actions give a different meaning to food. </p>

                <p>In the last semester of my course, I was exposed to information about 3d and WebXR. 
                    I think of website art as niche, but it has very widespread. 
                    Visually I refer to the 1984 publication The Romance of Food featuring over 170 pages of quirky technicolour. 
                    Food takes on a stunning storytelling quality under Cartland's camera. So I designed an oriental revolving round table with some exquisite Chinese delicacies on it. 
                    The Chinese word for 'reunion' is 'tuan yuan', and the idea of a family eating together around a round table is to show the unity and harmony of the family and to seek a rounded atmosphere. 
                    This is in line with our cultural emphasis on "collectivism". </p>

                <h3>Technical Implementation</h3>

                <!-- example of styling for three images, you can write your own styling -->
                <div class="flex-container flex-basis-third">
                    <div class="flex-item">
                        <img src="../assets/images/unity.png" style="
                        width: 536px;
                        height: 397px;
                       ">
                    </div>
                    <!-- <div class="flex-item">
                        <img src="../assets/images/repeating-diagonal-lines-square.jpeg"/>
                    </div>
                    <div class="flex-item">
                        <img src="../assets/images/repeating-diagonal-lines-square.jpeg"/>
                    </div>
                </div> -->
                
                <p>The whole project was mainly created using Unity, accompanied by Needle Engine for web building. 
                    It can automatically compile Three. during scene creation and deploy the local server to automatically open the test web pages. 
                    Needle will automatically convert ts scripts to C# and put them into Unity. 
                    I wanted to simulate the carousel effect of a round table so that 3d dishes could rotate on it, 
                    so I wrote a script about object rotation. </p>
            
                <!-- example of styling for three images, you can write your own styling -->
                <div class="flex-container flex-basis-half">
                    <div class="flex-item">
                        <img src="../assets/images/ts.png" style="
                        width: 510px;
                        height: 390px;
                        ">
                    </div>
                    <!-- <div class="flex-item">
                        <img src="../assets/images/repeating-diagonal-lines-rect.jpeg"/>
                    </div> -->
                </div>

                <p>I then added a Drag Control script to the 3d dishes, 
                    which allows the user to drag and drop more models onto the screen. 
                    This interaction means "more dishes, more luck". </p>

                <p>On the clouds in the mountains, I added the Screen Capture script and the Video Play Data script. 
                    When the user clicks on it on the web site they can share the open windows on their own computer. 
                    I want users to be able to use this feature to share photos of themselves while eating. </p>

                    <p>I then added a Drag Control script to the 3d dishes, 
                        which allows the user to drag and drop more models onto the screen. 
                        This interaction means "more dishes, more luck". </p>

                <h3>Reflection and Future Development</h3>
                <p>The Needle Engine is a web engine for 3D applications.
                    It runs on your machine for development and can be deployed anywhere. 
                    But I'm having a lot of trouble making it, so I'll be talking to the techies on Discord.</p>
                    <p>Unity itself is a very powerful engine, but I have not had much luck writing ts scripts, 
                        and many of the additional ones I have tried to implement have failed. 
                        I tried using Typescript in unity like buttons to toggle skyboxes, volume to affect object size, etc. 
                        but it all came up with an error. So I still need to do more research on this.</p>
                        <p>At first, I was hoping to incorporate a somatic game model that was communicating via UDP to transfer body data acquired by OpenCV to Unity, 
                            but no solution has been sought that would allow the Needle Engine to transfer OpenCV data since. 
                            Perhaps writing Javascript and then figuring out how to transfer it to the Three.js scene would be a solution.</p>
                            <p>Overall it's a handy tool to create web pages and can steadily piggyback complex 3d scenes on web pages. 
                                However, its functionality is not perfect and it requires a basic knowledge of Unity operations. 
                                During AR interaction, the shader sometimes reports errors when the user drags and drops objects via the touch screen/mouse, 
                                resulting in some strange tearing and deformation of the model. 
                                I also need to look into GLSL and GLM-related knowledge in the future.</p>
