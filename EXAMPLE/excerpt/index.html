        <p>
            We both know the history of violence that surrounds you</br>
            But I'm not scared, there's nothing to lose now that I've found you</br>
            And we could cruise to the news</br>
            Pico Boulevard in your used</br>
            Little bullet car if we choose</br>
            Mr. born to lose</br>
            Our <a href="#" class="dead-link">honeymoon</a>;</br>
            Say you want me too</br>
            Dark blue</br>
            There are violets in your eyes</br>
            There are guns that blaze around you</br>
            There are roses in between my thighs</br>
            And a fire that surrounds you</br>
            It's no wonder every man in town</br>
            Had neither fought nor found you</br>
            Everything you do is <span id="ghost">elusive</span></br>
            To even your honey dew</br>
